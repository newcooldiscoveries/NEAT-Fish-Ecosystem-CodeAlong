# NEAT-Fish-Ecosystem-CodeAlong

### Project files for the Simulated Fish Ecosystem created in Unity 3D. Here we use a NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies approach to training and evolving neural networks. We hope to create an environment where agents, that are represented by fish, learn how to find food for survival which will demonstrate machine learning.

#### To run this project you must have Unity Hub installed and download these files to any location on your computer. Than import the project to Unity through the Unity Hub. This project should work on all the recent versions of Unity.
