# NEAT-Fish-Ecosystem-CodeAlong

### Project files for the Simulated Fish Ecosystem created in Unity 3D. Here we use a NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies approach to training and evolving neural networks. We hope to create an environment where agents, that are represented by fish, learn how to find food for survival which will demonstrate machine learning.
